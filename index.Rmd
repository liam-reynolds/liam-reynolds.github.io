State of the Gap: Homeownership Disparities by Race and Ethnicity
============================================================================

Large gaps in homeownership rates and wealth persist between racial/ethnic groups as households of color face significant disadvantages relative to white households in both attaining and sustaining homeownership. The Black-white homeownership rate gap is almost as wide now as it was in 1960, when the Fair Housing Act had not yet been passed and housing discrimination was still legal (McCargo & Choi 2020).  The persistence of these gaps, long after overtly discriminatory practices have been barred, is evidence of the systemic barriers that still prevent people of color from receiving credit, or receiving it on terms as favorable as white borrowers. 

In the mid-20th century, the Federal Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC), the pre-curser to the Federal Housing Agency, explicitly and systematically denied mortgage lending to communities that were predominantly non-white through a process known as redlining Rothstein, 2017). Racially restrictive covenants in the early 20th  century prohibited African Americans, Latinos, Asians and other non-white households from purchasing or owning homes in certain, often affluent and white, communities (Turner a nd Greene). People of color had less access to the 30-year mortgages, revolving credit, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation–backed bank accounts that underpinne d the growing middle class. In their absence, costlier, riskier, and less regulated alternatives filled the void, using busine ss models that often trapped people in cycles of debt” (Perry, Choi, and Reynolds blog) and limited their ability to build a traditional credit history. For example, Black homebuyers disproportionately utilized land sale contracts to purchase housing, which lack the protections of mortgage financing in default scenarios. Between 1950-1970, in Chicago alone it is estimated land sale contracts stripped Black households of between 3.2 and 4.0 billion in wealth. (George et al. 2019, Brown 2016). 

More recently, driven by targeted lending of predatory products to borrowers of color, the great recession had a greater negative economic impact on homeowners of color. During the foreclosure crisis Black and Hispanic households were 76 and 71 percent more likely to be foreclosed on than white owners, respectively. (Bocian, Li and Ernst 2010, Neal and McCargo 2020, Choi et al. 2019). Negative shocks like recessions and natural disasters still disproportionally impact homeowners of color, widening gaps and setting vulnerable households further back. Prohibitively tight credit in the aftermath of the 2008 recession reduced lending to Black and Hispanic borrowers by 76 and 78 percent from 2005 to 2012 (Goodman, Zhu and George 2014). 

The staple legislation aimed at remedying historic lending discrimination, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), has fallen short of creating equal access to housing credit . Majority-minority communities receive less lending as a share of households than white neighborhoods, and research demonstrates that low-to-moderate designation that guides CRA activity is not a strong proxy for race (Goodman et al. 2022).

Wealth Disparities: Black Renters are Less Likely to Have Access to Wealth for Down Payments
============================================================================

Black and Latino families consistently cite lack of cash for downpayment and closing costs as the primary barrier to becoming homeowners (Goodman et al 2018). Black and Latino families have a fraction of the wealth of white families (see charts below). When cars (which are non-liquid assets and over overvalued by owners) are removed from the calculation, the median white families’ wealth goes from about 10 times the wealth of the median Black family and 8 times the wealth of the median Hispanic family, to more than 30 times the wealth of the median Black family and over 20 times the wealth of the median Hispanic family. Due to a legacy of being barred from wealth building opportunities, especially from the post WWII housing boom that created the white middle class, these gaps continue to compound from generation to generation.  Thirty percent of white families receive an inheritance or gift, compared to about 10 percent of Black families and 7 percent of Hispanic families. (Bhutta et al. 2020,).
These wealth disparities echo into all other areas of opportunity, across generations. For example, (A STAT FROM JUNG/KRISTEN’S STUDENT DEBT PAPER ON BORROWING FOR COLLEGE WHICH IN TURN MAKES IN HARDER TO BUY A HOME)
One report estimates that it would take the typical Latino renter household 11 years, and the typical Black renter household 14 years to save for a 5% downpayment; and this does not even factor in closing costs and reserve requirements. Black households are less likely to have had parents that were homeowners and/ or owned over $200,000 in wealth, both of which greatly increase the likelihood of becoming an owner (Choi,  Zhu & Goodman 2018 ). The median net worth of parents of young white adults is over $200,000, compared to less than $20,000 for parents of young Black adults and $35,000 for parents of young Latino adults. Gifts from relatives account for approximately 32% percent of down-payments for first-time home buyers  National Association  of Realtors 2019), and loans from family and friends are also a substantial source of downpayment (Zillow 2022). More than 1.7 million mortgage-ready young Black renters could afford a median-price home in the 31 most-populous metropolitan statistical areas if they could come up with a funds to close (McCargo, Choi, and Golding 2019 ). 
In 2019, households of color accounted for 32 percent of all households but only held 24 percent of primary-residence housing wealth (Neal et al.2021, Dettling et al.2017). Even when they do become homeowners, they often do not reap the same wealth-building benefits as white households. There is evidence that homes owned by people of color as well as homes located in majority non-white communities are systematically undervalued by appraisers (by $48,000 per home on average) and these homes are susceptible to larger errors even in automated-valuations (Perry  2018, Neal, Strochak and Young 2020)



Median Household Wealth {.tabset}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Median Wealth by Race, National
Black homebuyers are less likely to have access to wealth for down payments. The median wealth for Black households is $24,000. compared to $188,000 for white households.

Wealth and Homeownership {.tabset}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Wealth by Tenure, National
Homeownership is also a wealth-building vehicle, and the historic homeownership gap has limited wealth building opportunities for Black households. The median net worth for a homeowning household is $255,000, compared to only $6,300 for renters

```{r echo = FALSE}

  wealth_tenure %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = tenure, y = wealth)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size= 20),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 20))

```

### Homeownership Rate by Parental Wealth, National
Intergenerational wealth transfers also impact the ability to achieve homeownership. Homeownership rates increase as parental wealth increases.

```{r echo = FALSE}
 parent_wealth %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = parent_worth, y = rate)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Less than\n$10k", "$10k -\n$50k", "$50k -\n$150k", "$150k -\n$300", "$300k\n and above")) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size= 20),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 20))

```

Race and Downpayments {.tabset}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Percent of households putting down 5% or below and 20% or above by race, National
The wealth gap manifests in lower downpayments for Black households, limiting their homebuying options. Nationally, only 11% of Black households put down at least 20% on their home, compared to 39% for white households

```{r echo = FALSE}

  ltv_national %>% 
    ggplot(aes(fill = raceeth, x = down, y = rate)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "", labels = c("Black", "White", "Total")) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("At least 20%", "5% and below")) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size= 20),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 20))

```


### Percent of households putting down 5% or below and 20% or above by race, MSA
In the Atlanta - Sandy Springs - Alpharetta MSA, only 11% of Black households put down at least 20% on their home, comapred to 42% of white households.

```{r echo = FALSE}

  ltv %>% 
    filter(msa_name == "Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta, GA Metro Area") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(fill = race, x = payment, y = rate)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "", labels = c("Black", "White", "Total")) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("At least 20%", "5% and below")) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size= 20),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 20))

```


### Used Gov't or Nonprofit Downpayment Assistance, National
13% of Black households used government or nonprofit downpayment assistance, compared to only 6% of white households, further indicating that Black downpayment savings remain a barrier for Black households. 

```{r echo = FALSE}

  source %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = race_eth, y = govt_np_asst)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") + 
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "", labels = c("Black", "White", "Total")) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size= 20),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.title = element_text(size = 20),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 20))
